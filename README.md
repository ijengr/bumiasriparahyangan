## 🔧 Development

- Default admin user (seeded): `admin@example.com` / `password`
- To run locally:

```powershell
# create .env from example
copy .env.example .env
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan storage:link
npm install
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

Storage link note

- The project uses `storage/app/public` for uploaded files and the web-accessible link at `public/storage`.
- If you move the entire project folder to another location, re-run:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path .\public\storage -Recurse -Force
php artisan storage:link
```

This repository uses a relative junction for `public/storage` to reduce breakage when the project folder is moved inside the same drive.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
